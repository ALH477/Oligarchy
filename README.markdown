# Oligarchy NixOS

### Oligarchy NixOS is a custom NixOS distribution optimized for the Framework Laptop 16 (AMD Ryzen 7040 series), designed for developers, creators, gamers, and Framework enthusiasts. Inspired by Omarchy‚Äôs seamless installation, it provides a lightweight Hyprland desktop, a guided TUI installer, and extensive customization options. The system supports Flatpak and Snap packages, a robust gaming suite, a HydraMesh service for distributed communication, and hardware-specific optimizations, ensuring performance, low power consumption, and flexibility on Framework 16 and other hardware.
# In a time of ever increasing chaos, why would you want your technology to be the same? There's a solution, there's Oligarchy NixOS.

## Why Oligarchy NixOS is Optimized and Supreme

- **Low Idle Power Consumption**: Tailored for the Framework Laptop 16 with power-efficient settings:
  - **Power Profiles Daemon**: Dynamically adjusts CPU performance to minimize idle power usage (`power-profiles-daemon` enables balanced/low-power modes).
  - **AMDGPU Configuration**: Fine-tuned kernel parameters (`amdgpu.abmlevel=0`, `amdgpu.sg_display=0`, `amdgpu.exp_hw_support=1`) optimize GPU power draw, reducing idle consumption to as low as 5-7W on Framework 16.
  - **Fan Control**: `fw-fanctrl` ensures efficient cooling, reducing fan activity during low loads, further lowering power usage.
  - **Lid Switch Handling**: Configurable lid close behavior (`lid.sh`, `toggle_clamshell.sh`) disables the display to save power in clamshell mode.
- **Framework 16 Compatibility**: Leverages `nixos-hardware` and `fw-fanctrl` for AMD Ryzen 7040 support, including GPU drivers (`amdgpu`), firmware updates (`fwupd`), and fingerprint authentication (`fprintd`). Optional toggle ensures compatibility with other hardware.
- **Modular Package Management**: Nix‚Äôs declarative configuration allows precise control. Gaming (`steam`, `dhewm3`, `r2modman`, `darkradiant`), Snap, and HydraMesh services are optional, keeping the system lean.
- **Lightweight Desktop**: Hyprland with Waybar and Wofi provides a fast, Wayland-based environment, minimizing resource usage while supporting multi-monitor and clamshell setups.
- **Streamlined Installation**: TUI installer simplifies disk setup (LUKS-encrypted ext4), user configuration, and hardware options, ensuring quick deployment.
- **Customization Scripts**: Tools for resolution cycling, Hyprland configuration, theme switching, web app integration, HydraMesh toggling, and keybindings cheat sheet enhance user control, accessible via Wofi or keybindings.
- **Flatpak and Snap Support**: Flatpak is enabled by default for broad application access. Snap is optional, expanding software availability without compromising Nix‚Äôs reproducibility.

## Who and What It‚Äôs Good For

Oligarchy NixOS is ideal for users seeking a utilitarian, educational, stable, and accessible Linux experience. It emphasizes practical tools, learning opportunities, reliability, and ease of use, making it suitable for:

- **Developers and Learners**: Provides a robust toolset for programming (gcc, rustc, Python with scientific libraries like numpy and matplotlib, Go, SBCL with Lisp packages, Docker) and networking (Wireshark, nmap, Mininet). The declarative Nix configuration encourages educational exploration of system management, with scripts like `hyprland_config_modifier`, `theme_changer`, and `hydramesh-toggle` serving as practical examples for scripting and customization. The HydraMesh service, powered by the DeMoD-LISP SDK, supports distributed computing education with its P2P networking and AI-driven optimization. Tools like Nextflow and Snakemake offer utilitarian workflow management for data pipelines, while EMBOSS, BLAST, LAMMPS, and GROMACS provide stable platforms for bioinformatics and molecular simulations, accessible via the TUI installer for quick setup.
- **Creators and Content Producers**: Includes a comprehensive multimedia suite (Blender, Kdenlive, GIMP, Inkscape, Audacity, Ardour) for video editing, 3D modeling, audio production, and more. The hardware-accelerated graphics (Mesa, AMD Vulkan) ensure efficient performance, while accessibility features like Wofi app launcher and web app integration (`webapp_to_wofi`) streamline workflows. Its stability (Nix‚Äôs rollback capabilities) prevents disruptions during creative sessions. Natron offers utilitarian VFX compositing, while Sweet Home 3D provides educational 3D home planning, with tools like LibreCAD and QCAD enabling accessible CAD drafting for architects and designers.
- **Gamers and Modders**: Optional gaming toggle offers Steam, Lutris, Wine, dhewm3 (Doom 3 port), r2modman (mod manager), and DarkRadiant (level editor), optimized for Framework 16‚Äôs GPU. This setup is utilitarian for gamers who value low-power efficiency during non-gaming tasks, with educational value in exploring modding tools like DarkRadiant. Stability is ensured through Nix‚Äôs reproducible environments, preventing conflicts in gaming setups. HydraMesh‚Äôs P2P capabilities enhance multiplayer gaming with low-latency communication.
- **Framework Enthusiasts and Mobile Users**: Tailored for Framework Laptop 16 with power-efficient settings (5-7W idle), fan control, and hardware support, while remaining compatible with other systems. Its accessibility shines through the TUI installer and Wofi/keybinding-based tools, making it easy for hardware tinkerers to customize without deep technical knowledge. The distro promotes educational hardware experimentation (e.g., via `framework-tool`) and stability for daily use. Tools like SDR++ and xnec2c provide utilitarian software-defined radio and antenna simulation, accessible for radio engineers, with ELIZA offering an educational AI chatbot for computer science exploration. HydraMesh supports IoT applications with secure, low-latency communication.
- **Scientific Researchers and Engineers**: Features specialized tools like LAMMPS and GROMACS for molecular dynamics simulations, BLAST and EMBOSS for bioinformatics sequence analysis, and Snakemake/Nextflow for reproducible workflows. These enable utilitarian scientific computing, with Nix‚Äôs stability ensuring consistent results across environments. The distro is educational for researchers learning simulation techniques, accessible via pre-configured packages and scripts. The HydraMesh service supports IoT and edge computing research with low-latency P2P communication, toggleable via `SUPER+SHIFT+H`.

Overall, Oligarchy NixOS brings utilitarian efficiency through modular toggles and scripts, educational value via Nix‚Äôs declarative system and examples, stability with reproducible builds and hardware optimizations, and accessibility with a simple installer and intuitive desktop‚Äîmaking it a supreme choice for practical, learning-focused users on modern hardware.
