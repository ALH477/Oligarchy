## Why Oligarchy NixOS is Optimized and Supreme

Oligarchy NixOS stands out due to its carefully crafted features, ensuring a robust, secure, and user-friendly experience tailored to modern hardware and advanced use cases:

- **Low Idle Power Consumption**: Optimized for the Framework Laptop 16 with power-efficient settings:
  - **Power Profiles Daemon**: Dynamically adjusts CPU performance to minimize idle power usage (`power-profiles-daemon` enables balanced and low-power modes).
  - **AMDGPU Configuration**: Kernel parameters (`amdgpu.abmlevel=0`, `amdgpu.sg_display=0`, `amdgpu.exp_hw_support=1`) optimize GPU power draw, achieving 5-7W idle consumption on Framework 16.
  - **Fan Control**: The `fw-fanctrl` module ensures efficient cooling, reducing fan activity during low loads to further lower power usage.
  - **Lid Switch Handling**: Configurable scripts (`lid.sh`, `toggle_clamshell.sh`) disable the laptop screen in clamshell mode, saving power for external monitor setups.
- **Framework 16 Compatibility**: Leverages `nixos-hardware` and `fw-fanctrl` for AMD Ryzen 7040 support, including GPU drivers (`amdgpu`), firmware updates (`fwupd`), and fingerprint authentication (`fprintd`). A fallback option in the installer ensures compatibility with other hardware.
- **Modular Package Management**: Nix’s declarative configuration allows precise control over installed components. Features like gaming (`steam`, `lutris`, `dhewm3`), Snap support, and the HydraMesh service are optional, keeping the system lean and customizable.
- **Lightweight Desktop**: Hyprland, paired with Waybar (system status bar) and Wofi (application launcher), provides a fast, modern Wayland-based desktop environment, minimizing resource usage while supporting multi-monitor and clamshell configurations. Optional X11 support via Cinnamon and DWM.
- **Streamlined Installation**: A TUI installer simplifies disk setup (LUKS-encrypted ext4), user configuration, hardware options, and HydraMesh security settings (firewall and AppArmor), ensuring a quick, secure, and user-friendly deployment process.
- **Customization Scripts**: Tools for resolution cycling, Hyprland configuration, theme switching, web app integration, HydraMesh management, and a keybindings cheat sheet enhance user control, accessible via Wofi or keyboard shortcuts.
- **Flatpak and Snap Support**: Flatpak is enabled by default for broad application access, while Snap is optional, expanding software availability without compromising Nix’s reproducibility.
- **HydraMesh Service**: Integrates the DeMoD-LISP SDK for low-latency P2P communication, supporting transports like gRPC, WebSocket, and LoRaWAN. It includes a TUI configuration editor, Waybar status indicator, and robust security (systemd hardening, optional firewall, and AppArmor), making it ideal for IoT, gaming, and edge computing.
- **Virtual Camera Support**: Kernel module `v4l2loopback` enables virtual webcams for streaming and video conferencing.

## Security

Oligarchy NixOS prioritizes security, particularly for the HydraMesh service, which handles networked P2P communication for IoT, gaming, and edge computing. The HydraMesh service is secured through a multi-layered approach, adhering to industry best practices (e.g., NIST SP 800-53, CIS Controls) to mitigate risks from untrusted network inputs and potential exploits. Below is a detailed explanation of how HydraMesh is secured:

- **Systemd Hardening**:
  - **Dedicated User and Group**: HydraMesh runs as a dedicated `hydramesh` user and group, created dynamically with `DynamicUser = true`. This isolates the service from other system processes, preventing privilege escalation if compromised.
  - **Restricted Environment**: The systemd service (`systemd.services.hydramesh`) applies strict confinement:
    - `PrivateDevices = true`: Blocks access to hardware devices (e.g., `/dev/sda`, `/dev/input`).
    - `ProtectSystem = "strict"`: Mounts `/usr`, `/boot`, and `/etc` as read-only, preventing unauthorized modifications.
    - `ProtectHome = true`: Denies access to user home directories.
    - `PrivateTmp = true`: Provides a private `/tmp` directory, isolating temporary files.
    - `NoNewPrivileges = true`: Prevents the service from gaining new privileges (e.g., via setuid binaries).
    - `CapabilityBoundingSet = ""`: Removes all Linux capabilities, limiting kernel-level operations.
    - `RestrictNamespaces = true`: Restricts access to kernel namespaces (e.g., network, mount), reducing attack surface.
    - `SystemCallFilter = "@system-service ~@privileged"`: Whitelists only necessary system calls, blocking privileged operations (e.g., kernel module loading).
  - **Low-Level Mechanics**: These directives are enforced by systemd during service startup, creating a sandboxed environment. The service runs `/etc/hydramesh/` as its working directory, with `hydramesh` user permissions (UID/GID dynamically assigned at runtime).
  - **Value**: This aligns with containerization security principles (e.g., Docker’s default settings), ensuring robust isolation for networked applications.

- **Optional Firewall**:
  - **Dynamic Port Configuration**: If `services.hydramesh.firewallEnable` is set to `true` (prompted during installation), the firewall opens the TCP port specified in `/etc/hydramesh/config.json` (default 50051 for gRPC) and UDP 5683 for LoRaWAN if the `lorawan` plugin is enabled (`"plugins": {"lorawan": true}`).
  - **Implementation**: The `networking.firewall` section in `hydramesh.nix` uses `builtins.fromJSON` to parse `config.json` and dynamically set `allowedTCPPorts` and `allowedUDPPorts`. This ensures only necessary ports are exposed, reducing the attack surface.
  - **Low-Level Mechanics**: NixOS’s firewall, based on `iptables` or `nftables`, applies rules during system activation (`nixos-rebuild switch`). For example, if `port = 50051` and LoRaWAN is enabled, rules like `iptables -A INPUT -p tcp --dport 50051 -j ACCEPT` and `iptables -A INPUT -p udp --dport 5683 -j ACCEPT` are added.
  - **Value**: Follows network segmentation best practices (e.g., CIS Control 12), ensuring only required ports are open, critical for public-facing IoT or gaming nodes.

- **Optional AppArmor Profile**:
  - **Confinement**: If `services.hydramesh.apparmorEnable` is set to `true` (prompted during installation), an AppArmor profile confines the HydraMesh service (`/usr/bin/sbcl`) to:
    - Read access to `/etc/hydramesh/**` (configuration files).
    - Read/write access to `/var/lib/hydramesh/**` (StreamDB data).
    - TCP and UDP network access for communication (e.g., gRPC, LoRaWAN).
    - `capability dac_override` for file operations within allowed paths.
  - **Complain Mode**: The profile uses `flags=(complain)` to log violations without blocking, aiding debugging while maintaining security during production testing.
  - **Low-Level Mechanics**: The profile is generated in `hydramesh.nix` using `pkgs.writeText` and loaded into `/etc/apparmor.d/` during system activation. AppArmor’s kernel module enforces restrictions, logging violations to `/var/log/audit/audit.log` (if `auditd` is enabled).
  - **Value**: Provides mandatory access control, aligning with OWASP Top 10 mitigation strategies, protecting against file system exploits and unauthorized network access.

- **File System Permissions**:
  - **Dedicated Directories**: HydraMesh uses `/etc/hydramesh/` for configuration (read-only for `hydramesh` user) and `/var/lib/hydramesh/` for data (read/write). Permissions are set with:
    ```bash
    sudo chown hydramesh:hydramesh /var/lib/hydramesh /etc/hydramesh
    sudo chmod 755 /var/lib/hydramesh /etc/hydramesh
    sudo chmod 640 /etc/hydramesh/*
    ```
  - **Low-Level Mechanics**: The `hydramesh` user, created by `DynamicUser`, owns these directories, ensuring only the service can access them. The `640` mode restricts configuration files to read-only for non-owners, preventing unauthorized modifications.
  - **Value**: Enforces least privilege, a core security principle (e.g., NIST SP 800-53 AC-6), preventing tampering with sensitive files.

- **Secure Configuration Management**:
  - **TUI Editor**: The `hydramesh_config_editor.py` script validates `config.json` inputs against the D-LISP SDK schema, ensuring safe edits with JSON parsing and user confirmation prompts.
  - **Low-Level Mechanics**: The script uses Python’s `curses` for a TUI, `json` for parsing, and `re` for input validation (e.g., numbers, booleans, arrays). Changes are written to `/etc/hydramesh/config.json` only after user confirmation, reducing misconfiguration risks.
  - **Value**: Mitigates configuration errors, a common attack vector in networked services.

- **System-Wide Security Features**:
  - **AppArmor**: Enabled system-wide (`security.apparmor.enable = true`) for mandatory access control on all processes.
  - **Polkit and RTKit**: `security.polkit.enable = true` for authorization, and `security.rtkit.enable = true` for real-time kernel privileges in audio/pipewire.
  - **PAM for Fingerprint**: `security.pam.services.login.fprintAuth = true` and `sudo.fprintAuth = true` for secure authentication.
  - **Firewall**: Always enabled (`networking.firewall.enable = true`), with dynamic rules for HydraMesh.
  - **Value**: Provides layered defense, aligning with best practices for system integrity and access control.

- **Build Failures**:
  - Ensure `cargoSha256` in `hydramesh/flake.nix` is updated with:
    ```bash
    nix-prefetch-url --unpack file://$(pwd)/HydraMesh/streamdb
    ```
  - Verify `./HydraMesh/` contains `src/hydramesh.lisp`, `plugins/*.lisp`, and `streamdb/src/`.
  - Check internet connectivity for fetching dependencies, or use a cached `/nix/store`.

- **HydraMesh Issues**:
  - If the service fails to start, check logs:
    ```bash
    journalctl -u hydramesh
    ```
  - Ensure `libstreamdb.so` is built and accessible in `/etc/hydramesh/streamdb/lib/`.
  - Validate `config.json` with the TUI editor (`SUPER+SHIFT+E`).
  - Check AppArmor logs if enabled:
    ```bash
    journalctl -t apparmor
    ```

- **Installer Errors**:
  - Ensure the USB device is correctly identified (`lsblk`) and not mounted.
  - If LUKS decryption fails, verify the password matches the one set during installation.
  - For Framework 16 issues, confirm `nixos-hardware` and `fw-fanctrl` inputs are accessible.

## Notes

- **Doom 3**: `dhewm3` requires separately owned Doom 3 data files (e.g., from Steam).
- **Assets**: Ensure `wallpaper.jpg`, `hydramesh.svg`, and `./HydraMesh/` (with `src/hydramesh.lisp`, `plugins/*.lisp`, `streamdb/src/`) are in the repository root before building.
- **StreamDB Build**: Replace `cargoSha256` in `hydramesh/flake.nix` with the output of `nix-prefetch-url --unpack file://$(pwd)/HydraMesh/streamdb`. For advanced builds, use the separate StreamDB flake with Crane for WASM/encryption support.
- **Validation**: Locale/timezone inputs are not validated in the installer; use standard formats (e.g., `en_US.UTF-8`, `America/Los_Angeles`).
- **Flatpak/Snap**: Flatpak is enabled by default; Snap requires enabling during installation. Use `flatpak` or `snap` commands post-install.
- **HydraMesh Security**: The firewall (if enabled) opens the TCP port specified in `config.json` (default 50051) and UDP 5683 for LoRaWAN if enabled. AppArmor (if enabled) confines the service to `/etc/hydramesh/**` (read) and `/var/lib/hydramesh/**` (read/write) with TCP/UDP access.
- **Password Security**: User and root passwords are hashed using `mkpasswd -m sha-512` during installation for enhanced security.
- **Memory Management**: To exclude prior conversation references, go to "Data Controls" in settings or click the book icon beneath relevant messages to forget specific chats.
